## Our policy
Security is always the 1st priority when developing software, thats why our compromise with your security is on top of anything. Feel free to report any vulnerabilities you may encounter with our software, and we will do our best to solve them.

## Supported Versions
We like our users to be secure, but we cannot keep updated every version of the project because of logistics.
Support is given accordingly to the CVSS 3.0 security ratings. Here is a chart:
| CVSS 3.0 Rating | Supported Versions                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Critical        | Releases within previous 3 months |
| High/Medium     | Releases within previous month    |
| Low             | Latest release only               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a (suspected) vulnerability go to [Advisories](https://github.com/Dtar380/InvestmentPortfolioApp/security/advisories) and draft a new security advisory. Your issue will be completely private, and it will be disclosed once it passes the triage. Once it passes the triage a contributor will contact you, and once the issue is confirmed we will release a Patch ASAP.

The time to patch a vulnerability may vary depending on how complex is the issue, how much of the codebase is affected and if there are currently higher severity vulnerabilities reported, but a patch will usually be provided within less than a week.
